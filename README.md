### Design Process:

	* My fiancee and I both collaberated on this project.
	I used Pinterest to find inspiration: https://au.pinterest.com/stefanpiatkov/web-design-instripation/
	We picked some templates we both liked and thought would be a decent challenge.

	* She came up with some wireframes and I picked a few I liked for my layout, and then decided on a colour scheme we liked for my portfolio.
